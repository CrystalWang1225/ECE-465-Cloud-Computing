### Final Project - Blood Managment System with Amplify, React, Lambda, Serverless, DynamoDB


##### Built by [Kevin Jiang](https://github.com/kevinjiang11579) and [Crystal Yuecen Wang](https://github.com/CrystalWang1225)
##### Advised by Professor Rob Marano

### Purpose
In order to ensure an efficient usage of donated blood bag,the process of managing and obtaining blood bags needs to be structured. Currently, different hospitals and blood donation centers have ddiferent systems and approachese to handling blood bags. A blood bank management system is needed in order to help patients and hospitals in need to find matched blood and prevent error in an emergency situation.<br/>
The main objective of the project is to develope a system that helps facilitate the collection and distribution of the blood bags in order to help patients and hospitals with low stock of certain blood bags to find the closest the fastest matched blood availability.Other than only handling patient requests and donor registration, the application aims to maintain a balance of blood types available at each donation centern and hospitals.

### Interface
The blood management system is deployed using AWS amplify to support the React frontend as the framework. The backend cloud service is backed by serverless framework that auto-scales the application along with AWS lambda, the serverless compute device that automatically triggers from AWS services. Node.js is utilized to deploy the lambda functions.
